## What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language** designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is widely used for building applications ranging from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.

## Why Java is Interesting

- **Object-Oriented:** Everything in Java revolves around objects, making it modular and easy to maintain.
- **Platform Independent:** Write once, run anywhere — Java programs run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Rich Standard Library:** Java provides built-in classes and APIs for almost everything — from data structures to networking.
- **Strong Community & Ecosystem:** Tons of frameworks, tools, and libraries to accelerate development.
- **Safe & Robust:** Java handles memory management and error checking to prevent crashes and bugs.
