## Summary of what it consists:

- **Case Study 1:** A `Rectangle` class calculates the area from length and width, and checks if it is a square.
- **Case Study 2:** A `Circle` class lets the user choose with a switch case to find either the area or the circumference.
- **Case Study 3:** A loop is used to calculate and print the areas of 3 rectangles.
- **Case Study 4:** A switch case lets the user choose between `Rectangle` or `Circle`, and the chosen shape’s area is calculated.
- **Case Study 5:** The areas of a rectangle and a circle are compared using an `if` condition to see which is larger.
